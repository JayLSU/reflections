What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		Git generate a .git file and we need to use init to tell the git 
		version control that we want to track the history of the current
		directory.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
		Staging area is an intermediate space that allow us to track the 
		specific files in staging area. It help us to track each logical
		change at a time instead of track all the files in the working directory.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
		I am not sure what I have written about commit is true. I have to test it.
