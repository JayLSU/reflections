When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I need work on a different location and using different computer that does
    not have my files on my own computer. Using remote repository I can work anywhere
    and any place.    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometime when we collabrate with others, we may not want to 
    keep up-to-data version with our own local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking works onlu on github, it is like a github online version of 
    clone command. Clone command can copy repository remotely and 
    locally. We can clone repository from github to our own computer or 
    clone a repository from one directory to another. Branches are done
    in the same repository to create different versions of current 
    repository. When we want to clone entire repository from our github 
    account, we use clone. When we want to clone other's github repository
    to our github account, we use fork. When we want to keep different 
    version of our codes in the same repository, we use branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When we have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
    locally, we can know what is changed by the others on the github
    when we get offline. And we also can work offline and then merge 
    our new codes with that others have updated on the github.
